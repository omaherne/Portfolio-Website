For this portfolio website, I wanted to showcase my skills, experience, and myself to possible future employers. 
I chose to include these things because they will be used to judge me as a candidate for a job that I have applied for.
I added in some sleek design, and a horizontal menu bar at the top for easy navigation. I included contacts and clickable icons
at the bottom to go to my linkedIn and GitHub pages.
